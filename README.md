# InverseKinematics
My own coded version of Inverse kinematics for my robotic arm

This program is specific to the robotic arm I designed. It has 4 segments, 3 are used for the shoulder movement, and 1 is used for the elbow. For debuging purposes, there is an option to randomize the rotation and location of the target. The distance from the actual position of the arm to the target position is the score. A lower score is better. Currently, the code is not designed to be built in as a function to a larger project, but in the future, I plan to add the finialized code when I get to that stage of my project.
